## This is the Python 3 version of the "weaponized" exploit for `CVE-2016-6210`

### Background:

###### The brief:
>By sending large passwords, a remote user can enumerate users on system that runs SSHD. This problem exists in most 
modern configuration due to the fact that it takes much longer to calculate SHA256/SHA512 hash than BLOWFISH hash.

###### The (more) technical:
>When SSHD tries to authenticate a non-existing user, it will pick up a fake password structure hardcoded in the SSHD 
source code. On this hard coded  password  structure  the password hash is based on BLOWFISH ($2) algorithm.
If real users passwords are hashed using SHA256/SHA512, then sending large passwords (10KB) will result in shorter 
response time from the server for non-existing users.
